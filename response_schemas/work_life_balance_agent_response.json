Working 12-hour days can lead to chronic fatigue, sleep issues, and emotional detachment, which are all signs of burnout. It's important to address these feelings before they escalate further. Remember, prioritizing your well-being is essential for long-term success. Here are some strategies you might consider: 1. Set strict boundaries on your working hours and communicate them with your team. For example, you could establish a policy of not checking emails after a certain time. 2. Practice energy management by scheduling regular breaks and engaging in activities that recharge you, such as exercise or hobbies.
